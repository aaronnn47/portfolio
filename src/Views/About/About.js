      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Aaron Kim and I am currently pursuing a career in
        engineering. One of my passions is to build
        things from scratch and solve puzzles. My mind is
        always learning and searching for creative solutions to complex problems our society faces.
        My thirst for finding innovation and technologies such as blockchain, induction motors,
        inverters, solar panels and lithium batteries is what makes me
        want to become an engineer. I also believe computer programming 
        will one day be the foundation for our learning process. Coding is a great 
        way to connect the world we live in as well as connecting machine languages
        to hardware and electronics. As a developer and designer I want to create an app
        thatâ€™ll allow people to create their own products and services while getting
        paid in the process. We currently live in an economy that benefits certain
        individuals and leave millions pushed aside. If we create our own products and goods
        we can take away business from companies like Amazon and Walmart. They are the reason
        why so many Americans feel as though they don't have a path forward. My Apps will restore
        some passion and purpose to those affected by the gross inequalities in this world.
        My Apps and businesses will create jobs and redistribute money and wealth more evenly across
        our country and start cleaning up the mess we created for ourselves.
