      <p>
        Hello, my name is Aaron Kim and I am currently pursuing a career in
        software engineering. Some of my favorite things to do are building
        things from scratch and solve puzzles such as the rubix cube. My mind is
        always searching for the next best thing. My thirst for finding
        innovated technologies such as blockchain technology is what makes me
        stand out from others. I believe programming will one day be the
        foundation for our future. Coding is a great way to understand the world
        we live in now. As a full stack developer I want to create an app
        thatâ€™ll allow people to seemlessly integrate blockchain technology in
        everyday purchases. Aside from coding, I like to explore nature and find
        creative ways to pursue adventures.
